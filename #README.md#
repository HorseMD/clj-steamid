# steamid

Conversion tool to switch between the 3 different forms of SteamID:

* steamid
* steamid64
* steamid3

Should work in both Clojure and ClojureScript projects.

In your `project.clj` or equivalent:

```clojure
...
        :dependencies [...
                      [steamid "0.1.0"]]
                      ...
```

## Usage

that type.

```clojure
...:require [steamid.core :refer [steamid3 steamid steamid64]

(steamid3 "76561198060824051")
; => "[U:1:100558323]"

(steamid64 "STEAM_0:1:50279161")
; => "STEAM_0:1:50279161"

(steamid "[U:1:100558323]")
; => "76561198060824051"
```

All SteamIDs returned are Strings.
